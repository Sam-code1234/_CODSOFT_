        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[pron 1] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an
        Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign
        for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific
        Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

        Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs,
        including what influenced him. Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him
        as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances
